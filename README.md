# Github-Finder
This is github user profile finder web application made using HTML, CSS and Javascript. I am using github api for users https://api.github.com/users.
We need to provide the github username to get the user data such as public repos, following, followers, latest five repositories of the profile and much more.
We can also go to the github account of the username specified.
I am using github api keys provided by github. We require client id and client secret id for making an api call.
Here two api calls are made. One for profile response and other for latest five repositories response.
